## PROJECT #2 DESCRIPTION
It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past 8 weeks together! For
project #2 you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web
development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends,
family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of
web application you create is your choice.

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

You will be working **in groups** for this project. Show us what you've
got!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are
associated correctly!
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data and
handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid email
addresses and secure passwords.
* **Use Gems** Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app.
* **User Login.** Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up (if you need it).
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
We may not have covered all of these in class, but if you want to push yourself
and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with
your app.

* **Front-end Framework.** Use either Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation to kick start your front-end.
* **File upload.** Take a look at carrierwave and AWS/S3.
* **Web Scraping.** Check out Nokogiri.


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

#### Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do
you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and
how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing
software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.
* **Milestones.** For this we used Trello to tackle our goals everyday to be able to stay on task
